## basic info

In attempting to successfully meet the goal of leaving a code cleaner and more concise than when I found it, 
I thoroughly went through, to the best of my ability, and replaced non semantic code with semantic code.

Semantic code is important as when you apply more meaning to it using tags that have specific roles, in lieu of simply using divs and spans.
