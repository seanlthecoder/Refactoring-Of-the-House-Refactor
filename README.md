# Refactoring Challenge


## The Horiseon webpage.

The ultimate goal with this code is to provide codebase that follows accessibility standards.

Another goal is to make sure code follows semantic concepts so that the code is realtively cleaner or as clean as possible.

The code has been scanned and Semantic HTML elements has replaced non semantic html elements.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Technologies

This code was refactored using:
 Visual Studio Code
 Version: 1.72.1





## basic info

In attempting to successfully meet the goal of leaving a code cleaner and more concise than when I found it, 
I thoroughly went through, to the best of my ability, and replaced non semantic code with semantic code.

Semantic code is important as when you apply more meaning to it using tags that have specific roles, in lieu of simply using divs and spans.
